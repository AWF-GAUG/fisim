\usage{
response(data, r_design, r_design_parm)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} object holding identifiers
for the sample and respective point locations and row indices that indicate
which population elements are selected into the sample. data must have
the columns "id_sample", "id_point", "s" and "ef".}

\item{r_design}{A \code{character} string indicating the type of the response
design. One of the following: "fixed_area", "k_tree", "angle_count".}

\item{r_design_parm}{A response design specific parameter of type
\code{numeric}. For "fixed_area" the plot radius in meter; for "k_tree" the
number of trees closest to the sample location; for "angle_count" the basal
area factor.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{response}. A named list with the following
entries:

  \itemize{
  \item \code{$data} A \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}}
  object as described above.
  \item \code{$r_design}
  \item \code{$r_design_parm}
  }
}
\description{
The function \code{response} creates response design objects that store the
results of a particular response design that was applied at given sample
locations to some tree population. The function is only used internally by
the functions that apply the particular response designs:
\code{\link{fixed_area}}, \code{\link{k_tree}}, \code{\link{angle_count}}.
}
\details{
The \code{\link[data.table]{data.table}} object (\code{data}) should
  have the following columns:
  \itemize{
  \item \code{id_sample}
  \item \code{id_point}
  \item \code{s}
  \item \code{ef}
  }

  Some response designs (currently only \code{\link{k_tree}}), may add
  additional alternative expansion factors as optional approximations, where
  unbiased estimators are missing or difficult to derive.
