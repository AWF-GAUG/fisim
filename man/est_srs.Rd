\title{Simple random sampling estimator of population means}
\usage{
est_srs(point_data, est_col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{point_data}{A data.table object with plot-level information of stand
characteristics as coming from the \code{sum_data} function.}

\item{est_col}{A character vector of column names for which estimates are
produced. Used when there is more than one way to expand observations from
individual sample locations.}
}
\value{
A data.table object with mean and variance estimates for the target
 variables.
}
\description{
Simple random sampling estimator of population means
}
\details{
Variance estimation is done following the simple random sampling
  estimator for replicated sampling.
