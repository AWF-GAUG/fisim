#' @details The RANN package is used to find all trees within the specified

#'   neighbors within \code{r} are searched for. To find all trees within
#'   \code{r}, \code{k} should be large enough (max the number of rows in

#'   multiplying the average tree density with plot area. Tree density is
#'   inferred using the \code{density.ppp} function from the spatstat package.

#'   height).
#' @param sample_loc A data.table object as returned from
#'   \code{\link{xy_sample}}. The first column is an identifier, the second and
#'   third store sample location coordinates, respectively. The number of rows
#'   corresponds to the size of the sample.
#' @param baf Basal area factor. Determines together with the trunk diameter at
#'   1.3 m height up to which distance trees are included in the sample. Typical
#'   values for temperate forest conditions range between 1 and 4. The number of
#'   trees included at a sample location multiplied with the \code{baf} gives a
#'   direct estimate of basal area in square meter per hectare.
#' @param k Helper variable needed in the \code{\link{nn2}} function for the
#'   kd-tree search of candidate trees that are possibly included into the
#'   sample. Maximum the numer of rows in \code{tree_loc}. See details.
#' @details The selection of trees according to the Bitterlich/ange-count method
#'   was implemented in several steps. First the critical distance up to which a
#'   tree is selected from a specific sample location is calculated using
#'   \code{tree_dbh} and \code{baf}. The larger \code{tree_dbh} and \code{baf},
#'   the larger the critical distance of inclusion. In the second step the RANN
#'   package is used to identify candidate trees for inlcusion into the sample
#'   and their distances to the sample locations. The RANN package is a wrapper
#'   for the Approximate Near Neighbor (ANN) C++ library allowing for fast
#'   nearest-neighbor searches using kd-trees. Here, radius search is used,
#'   meaning that the \code{k}-nearest neighbors within a specific radius are
#'   searched for. As a radius the maximum critial distance is used. In
#'   combination with \code{k}, a larger than necessary sample of trees is
#'   selected at each sample location. If not specified by the user, \code{k} is
#'   estimated by multiplying the average tree density with the area of a circle
#'   with the maximum critical distance as radius. Tree density is inferred
#'   using the \code{density.ppp} function from the spatstat package. Note that
#'   the estimation costs some extra computation time and it is thus recommended
#'   to provide a large enough \code{k} when the function is used in
#'   simulations. In the third and last step, the set of candidate trees is
#'   querried for trees, where the actual distance to the sample location is
#'   smaller than the individual critical distance.

#'   represent indices of the trees in \code{tree_loc} that are selected at the
